# Easy-use

Those scripts are mainly intended for non-developer users. It eases the process of running a basic configuration for your machine and allowing you to quickly work with GitHub.

## How to get those scripts

Two solutions:
1. You can clone `git-assist` [repository](https://github.com/alexlemaire/git-assist) on your machine to access those scripts directly
2. You will also find the latest version to download [here](https://cdn.klimapartner.net/alexis/@git-assist/easy-use.zip) as a _ZIP_ archive

## Scripts

| Script  | `install.sh`                                                               | `machine-config.sh`                                                                                                       | `clone.sh`                                   |

**Important:**
- for all those scripts, you should copy them in the folder you want to work from and delete them afterward. This will be improved later on
- those scripts probably will work only if you're using Linux!
