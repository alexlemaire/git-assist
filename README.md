# git-helper

**WIP**

This helper allows users to easily manage _GitHub_ on their machine. Some features are aimed at developers while some are aiming novice users/non developers.

_Features:_
- setup `git` user
- generate/configure SSH key
- generate/configure GPG key
- easy push (git add/commit/push all in one via interactive CLI)
- automatically pull for repositories (on machine startup/schedule/etc). Offers configuration options

_Note:_ this is an expansion upon a private work made to automate git pull at machine startup for every repositories.
